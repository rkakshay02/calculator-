# Calculator Project

This calculator project is a simple command-line calculator implemented in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. Project Structure:
Outline the main components of your project, explaining the purpose of each file or directory. In this case, you might have a main Python script (calculator.py), and possibly additional files for external dependencies or configurations.



- `calculator.py`: The main Python script containing the calculator functionality.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing information about the project.
- (Optional) Other files or directories for external dependencies, configuration, etc.
3. Instructions for Running the Calculator:
Provide clear instructions on how to run and use your calculator. Include any dependencies that need to be installed and steps to execute the program.
  1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
  2. Install the required dependencies using: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if you have any external dependencies).
  3. Run the calculator script: `python calculator.py`.
  4. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform calculations.
   
4. Code Explanation:
Briefly explain the purpose of the main parts of your code, especially focusing on any unique or complex features.


- `calculator.py`: This script defines basic arithmetic functions and implements a simple command-line calculator. It utilizes the `art` library for displaying an ASCII art logo and the `replit` library for clearing the console.
5. Future Improvements:
If you have plans for future improvements or features, mention them in this section.

- Implement support for more advanced mathematical operations.
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly exper
